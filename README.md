# Quidditch-League-player-Prediction

Quidditch is the most popular game in the wizarding world. Like games played in the real world,
Quidditch too has its own set of rules and regulations.
In this project you will be working on a classification problem based on a Quidditch dataset. Your task
is to predict whether a player makes it to Professional League Quidditch upon graduation from Hogwarts
or not based on other features of the player in the dataset.


Implemented neural network, logistic regression and random forest classifier on the Quidditch League player classifier to predict whether a player makes it to Professional League Quidditch upon graduation from Hogwarts or not.
Performed pre-processing of data such as replacing missing values, balancing data using smote, normalization, applying on hot encoding on the data and performed feature engineering on data to select the best features from the dataset.
â€¢Used Area under the curve, classification report and confusion matrix to test the efficiency of the model.
